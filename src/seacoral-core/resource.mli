    [installer] under the name [resname].  The resulting handle can be passed to
    {!install} (see below) to actually call [installer] and get the associated
    installation directory. *)

(** {2 Procedures that actually install resources} *)

(** [install handle resdir_root] ensures the installer associated with [handle]
    has been called with a directory [dir] under [resdir_root], and returns
    [dir].

    No assumption can be made {i w.r.t} the name of [dir], except that it is
    guaranteed to be a sub-directory of [resdir_root]. *)

(** [install_all_in resdir_root] runs every installer registered with
    directories under [resdir_root] (if they have not already ran or started
    running within the same directory), and returns once they have all
    completed.

    This procedure may be useful to pre-install every known resources in
    advance. *)
