(** [monitor_dir ~on_close dirname] asynchronously monitors file creations or
   modifications in directory [dirname], and calls [on_close] with the name [f]
   of any such file after it has been closed.

   This function awaits for the creation of [dirname] if it does not exist upon
   call.  Note, thought, that if such is the case then that the monitoring
   cannot start right at the time the directory is created: for this reason, one
   cannot guarantee that every event triggers a call to [on_close] in this case.
   This limitation does not apply in case [dirname] already exists upon call.

   Note: inotify events are queued whenever there is one non-terminated call to
   [on_close].

   Fails with {!File.MISSING} if [dir] is not, or does not end up being, a
   directory. *)

      creations in directory [dirname]: [on_close] is subsequently called with any
      file [f] newly created in [dirname].

      The function promised must be called at most once to terminate the
      registration of [f].

      not exist upon call. *)
