Seacoral's configuration
========================

Configuration file
------------------

SeaCoral can be configured differently via a `toml` file with the option `-C`.

Options can be `project-defining` or `runtime`, depending on how they influence
the analysis. If a `project-defining` option is changed between two analyses,
a new separate project will be created and the old results will not be used.
If a `runtime` option is changed beween two analyses, it will re-use the
previous project.

Note that you can generate a new configuration file with `$ seacoral init`.
It will create a `seacoral.toml` that you can use to start the analysis.

.. The following documentation can be generated with "$ seacoral doc dump --rst <file>".

Logs configuration options [logs]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `console-level` [runtime knob]: Console log level: use 0 for no message, 1 for application-level messages
  only, 2 to include error messages, 3 to include warnings as well, 4 for more
  information, and 5 or any other value for full debug messages (default: 3).
  
 
Run configuration options [run]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `workdir` [runtime knob]: Directory where the working files are stored (defaults to "_sc").
  
- `display-outcomes` [runtime knob]: When set to "yes", displays for each test which labels it covers ("yes" by default).
  
- `max-validation-concurrency` [runtime knob]: Maximum number of concurrent validations (defaults to 16). A null value
  enables unlimitted parallelism.
  
- `verbose-validation` [runtime knob]: When set, show labels reached during test validation in logs (false by default).
  
- `force-preprocess` [runtime knob]: Force preprocessing, even if it has already been performed.
  
- `enable-syntax-check` [runtime knob]: Whether to check for syntax errors in input files prior to labeling and test generation (true by default).
  
- `strategy` [runtime knob]: Employ the given orchestration strategy: 's' stands for sequential, 'p' for parallel, and 'o' for optimized.  The default is "p".
  
- `test-timeout` [runtime knob]: Time (in seconds) after which a test execution is considered to fail (1.000
  by default).
  
- `tools` [runtime knob]: Tools to use. Defaults to []. Use ["*"] to select every known tool.
  
 
Project configuration options [project]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- `ignored-globals` [project-defining knob]: Global variables that should be ignored.
  
- `external-libs` [runtime knob]: External libraries required to compile the project, like "m" for the math
  library, for instance. Defaults to [].
  
- `name` [project-defining knob]: Name for the project: this is used in logs and to name the working directory.
  
- `files` [project-defining knob]: C files to consider.
  
- `criterion` [project-defining knob]: Coverage criterion (case-insensitive). Launch `frama-c -lannot-list` for a list of available criteria (default: "CC"). If you used custom labels, you can use the "Custom" or "Empty" criterion.
  
- `entrypoint` [project-defining knob]: Entrypoint for the project.

- `functions-to-cover` [project-defining knob]: Comma-separated list of functions to cover. Use an empty string to automatically cover the entrypoint and any function it may call (this is the default); note this is achieved using an analysis of the syntactic callgraph, so function pointers are ignored. Use '*' to select every function defined in the project.
  
- `include-dirs` [project-defining knob]: Directories where header files are searched for (default: []).
  
 
Pointer-handling configuration options [pointer-handling]

  Default is 20.
  
- `max-non-nil-ptr-depth` [project-defining knob]: Maximal depth at which pointers may be non-NULL, measured in number of
  pointer dereferences from function arguments. Default is 3.
  
- `treat-pointer-as-string` [project-defining knob]: Formal arguments or global variables that are declared as naked pointers to
  characters (`char *p`), but need to be treated as '\000'-terminated C-strings
  (default: []).
  
- `array-size-mapping` [project-defining knob]: Pairs of variables of the form `"p:n"`, where `p` is a pointer (formal
  argument to the entrypoint, or global variable), and `n` is a variable of
  integral type that represents the length of the array pointed to by `p` (in
  number of elements of type `t`, if `p` is of type `t*`).
  
- `treat-pointer-as-array` [project-defining knob]: Formal arguments or global variables that are declared as naked pointers
  (like `int *p` or `struct t * x`), but need to be treated as arrays (default:

  return a zero value of an integral type (like `int`) if and only if the
  oracle fails.

  uncoverable.

  analysis or tests generation is started (default: [])

About pointer specification
---------------------------

The core configuration options `treat_pointer_as_array/cstring` require a list of pointers.
It is possible to directly specify inputs or fields of a given structure.
Examples

- `treat-pointer-as-array = ["foo"]`: input `foo` is not only a pointer, but an array with
  several elements whose size is bounded by `max-ptr-array-length`.
- `treat-pointer-as-cstring = [{struct t}.p]`: all values of type `struct t` in the input
  has a field `p` that must be a a `char*` and is a string. 

A similar syntax is used for `array-size-mapping`: this list is a list of pairs of
named locations separated by ':'.

- `array-size-mapping=[arr:N]`: the input `arr` is an array that must have size `N`.
- `array-size-mapping=[{struct s}:a:N]`: all values of type `struct s` in the input
  has a field `a` that is an array of `N`.

..
  The core configuration options `treat_pointer_as_array/cstring` require a list
  of "named locations". Named locations represent a position in the memory layout
  of the test input.
  It is possible to directly write variables (for example, `foo` in
  `treat_pointer_as_array` will specify the pointer `foo` must be treated as a reference to
  an array).

  It is also possible to specify indirect pointers. For example, for an input 
  `char **foo`, you may add `foo[_]` in `treat_pointer_as_cstring`
  to specify that pointers accessed via `*foo` or `foo[i]`, for some `i`, 
  point to C character strings.
  You may also specify a path in a structure (`foo.bar.tri...`), or even every
  structure of a given type (`{struct:t}.foo.bar.tri...`).
  Use of the `->` operator is also permitted to represent the access of a pointer
  field (`x->y` is equivalent to `x[_].y`).

  A similar syntax is used for `array_size_mapping`: this list is a list of pairs of
  named locations separated by ':'.
  For example, the string `x.y:N` states that the field `y` of `x` is an array that
  must have size `N`, where `x` and `N` either are globals or formals of the
  tested function.
  It also is possible for a structure to reference itself:
  `{struct:t}.y:.N` states that for any structure `s` of type `t` in the input,
  `s.y` is an array whose size must be equal to `s.N`.

Command line
------------

Previous options can be accessed via the command line interface with their key
(for example, `$ seacoral --force-preprocess`). Both the configuration file and
CLI arguments can be used; CLI arguments will override keys set up in the
configuration file.
