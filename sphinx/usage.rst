Seacoral's workflow
-------------------

Consider the following example with a single condition.

.. code-block:: c
   :caption: get_sign.c

   int get_sign(int i) {
     if (i < 0) return -1;
     return 1;
   }


This function has two branches: either `i` is strictly negative or `i` is positive.
Our goal is to generate a test case for each of these branches, proving all
the code is reachable. SeaCoral will work as follows.

1. First, it will call `LTest <https://micdel.fr/ltest.html>`_ for annotating the
   C code with `predicate coverage labels`, or `pc_label` s.
   We are not talking here about usual C labels; `pc_label` s are defined as source
   code location associated to a C boolean expression. A label is said `reachable`
   if there exist a function input for which the label location is reached and the
   boolean expression evaluated to a non null integer.

  .. code-block:: c
     :caption: get_sign_label.c

     int get_sign(int i) {
       int __retres;
       pc_label(i < 0,1);
       pc_label(! (i < 0),2);
       if (i < 0) {
         __retres = -1;
         goto return_label;
        }
       __retres = 1;
       return_label: return __retres;
     }

  We have two `pc_label` s, one for each function branch: `i < 0` and `i ≥ 0`.

2. Then, `seacoral` calls a given set of tools to analyze the labelized C code.
   The tools orchestrated by `seacoral` are `klee`, `libfuzzer`, `cbmc` and
   `luncov`.
   Each of them create a custom harness where each `pc_label` correspond to specific
   instructions built from tool internals.

3. Once each tool finished their analysis, they provide the test cases they
   found for covering the function branches and produce a coverage report.

Simple example
--------------

Running `seacoral` on this file with `klee` will automatically start the previous workflow:

  .. code-block::

    $ seacoral --files get_sign.c --entrypoint get_sign --tools klee
    [A]{Sc} Starting to log into `_sc/get_sign.c-CC-@3/logs/1.log'
    [A]{Sc} Initializing working environment...
    [A]{Sc} Doing the hard work...
    [A]{Sc} Launching klee on `get_sign'
    [A]{Sc} Extracting new testcases from corpus...
    [A]{Sc} Hard work done
    [A]{Sc} Coverage statistics for `get_sign':
    cov: 2 (100.0%) uncov: 0 (0.0%) unkwn: 0 (0.0%) with 2 tests
    [A]{Sc} Covered labels: {1, 2}
    [A]{Sc} Uncoverable labels: {}
    [A]{Sc} Crash statistics: rte: none
    [A]{Sc}        1: Covered
                   2: Covered
    Coverage: (2/2) 100.0%


The generated tests can be found in the file `_sc/get_sign.c-CC-last/tests/cov/testsuite.c`.

.. code-block:: c
  :caption: testsuite.c

  void test_1 () {
     /* Found by klee after 1s550 in run 1 */
     /* Outcome: covering labels {1} */
     /* Globals, if any */
     /* Effective argument(s), if any */
     int i;
     i = -2147483648;
     (void) get_sign (i);
  }

  void test_2 () {
    /* Found by klee after 1s553 in run 1 */
    /* Outcome: covering labels {2} */
    /* Globals, if any */

    /* Effective argument(s), if any */
       int i;
       i = 0;
       (void) get_sign (i);
  }

   int main () {
     test_1 ();
     test_2 ();
     return __sc_exit_status;
   }

The first test reaches the first `pc_label` (`i < 0`) while the second
one reaches the second `pc_label` (`i ≥ 0`).

Using multiple tools
--------------------

This section presents the usage of `sc` on the `tritype` example, checking
the property of a triangle.

.. code-block:: c
  :caption: tritype.c

  /* Should return the type of the triangle
     which has sides of these lengths.
     4 = not a triangle
     3 = equilateral triangle
     2 = isoceles triangle
     1 = other triangle
  */

  struct triangle {
    int i;
    int j;
    int k;
  };

  int tritype(struct triangle t){
    int type_code;
    int i = t.i;
    int j = t.j;
    int k = t.k;
    if ((i == 0) || (j == 0) || (k == 0)) type_code = 4;
    else {
      type_code = 0;
      if (i == j) type_code = type_code + 1;
      if (i == k) type_code = type_code + 2;
      if (j == k) type_code = type_code + 3;
      if (type_code == 0){
        if ((i+j <= k) || (j+k <= i) || (i+k <= j))
  	  type_code = 4;
  	else
  	  type_code = 1;
      }
      else if (type_code > 3) type_code = 3;
      else if ((type_code == 1) && (i+j > k)) type_code = 2;
      else if ((type_code == 2) && (i+k > j)) type_code = 2;
      else if ((type_code == 3) && (j+k > i)) type_code = 2;
      else if (type_code > 10) type_code = -1;
      else type_code = 4;
    }
    return type_code;
  }

The label annotation step (1.) returns 36 labels, one for each boolean
expression in conditions and its negation. One of these labels is actually
unreachable: the last condition `type_code > 10` is actually impossible.  If we
start SeaCoral with `klee`, `libfuzzer` or `cbmc`, only 35 labels out of 36 will be
covered:

  .. code-block::

    $ ./seacoral --files tritype.c --entrypoint tritype --tools libfuzzer
    [A]{Sc} Starting to log into `_sc/tritype.c-CC-@1/logs/1.log'
    [A]{Sc} Initializing working environment...
    [A]{Sc} Doing the hard work...
    [A]{Sc} Launching libfuzzer on `tritype'
    [A]{Sc} Extracting new testcases from corpus...
    [A]{Sc} Hard work done
    [A]{Sc} Coverage statistics for `tritype': cov: 35 (97.2%) uncov: 0 (0.0%) unkwn: 1 (2.8%) with 10 tests
    [A]{Sc} Covered labels:
    {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36}
    [A]{Sc} Uncoverable labels: {}
    [A]{Sc} Crash statistics: rte: none


SeaCoral saved the result of this analysis in `_sc/tritype.c-CC-tritype-last` —
which is a symbolic link equivalent to `_sc/tritype.c-CC-tritype-@1` in the
above log.  The status of the project will be re-used by the next analyses of
`tritype`. We can now use one of the tools that allows to discover uncoverable
labels in the code: `cbmc-assert`, `cbmc-clabel` or `luncov`.

  .. code-block::

     $ ./seacoral --files tritype.c --entrypoint tritype --tools cbmc --cbmc-mode assert
     [A]{Sc} Starting to log into `_sc/tritype.c-CC-@2/logs/2.log'
     [A]{Sc} Initializing working environment...
     [A]{Sc} Current coverage statistics for `tritype': cov: 35 (97.2%) uncov: 0 (0.0%) unkwn: 1 (2.8%) with 10 tests
     [A]{Sc} Doing the hard work...
     [A]{Sc} Launching cbmc on `tritype'
     [A]{Sc} Extracting new testcases from corpus...
     [A]{Sc} Hard work done
     [A]{Sc} Coverage statistics for `tritype': cov: 35 (97.2%) uncov: 1 (2.8%) unkwn: 0 (0.0%) with 10 tests
     [A]{Sc} Covered labels:
     {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36}
     [A]{Sc} Uncoverable labels: {35}

We see that `cbmc` in `assert` mode discovered a new uncoverable label,
corresponding to the impossible condition.

NB: tools can be used in parallel by giving a list of tools (separated by a
comma) to the `--tools` option.

Annotations
-----------

Here is one of the tests generated by libfuzzer:

.. code-block:: c
  :caption: Part of testcases.c

  void test_1 () {
      /* Found by libfuzzer after 2s689 in run 1 */
      /* Outcome: covering labels {2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 14, 21} */
      /* Globals, if any */

      /* Effective argument(s), if any */
      struct triangle t;
      (void) memcpy (&(t),
                 &(struct triangle){.i = 16843009, .j = 16843009, .k = 16843009},
                 sizeof (struct triangle));
      (void) tritype (t);
   }

While this is a perfectly valid test, the negative value of `j` is disapointing
(as we are working with triangles). We definitely should have used `unsigned int` instead of
`int` in our triangle structure definition.

But let's say there is an invariant forcing these values to be strictly positive
in the project using the `tritype` function. We want to generate tests that only
include triangles with positive values. SeaCoral allows to annotate the function with
the instruction `sc_assume(p)`, where `p` is a boolean expression.

.. code-block:: c
  :caption: tritype_annoted.c

  #include<seacoral/annots.h>

  struct triangle {
    int i;
    int j;
    int k;
  };

  int tritype(struct triangle t){
    int type_code;
    int i = t.i;
    int j = t.j;
    int k = t.k;
    sc_assume(i > 0);
    sc_assume(j > 0);
    sc_assume(k > 0);
    if ((i == 0) || (j == 0) || (k == 0)) type_code = 4;
    else {
      type_code = 0;
      if (i == j) type_code = type_code + 1;
      if (i == k) type_code = type_code + 2;
      if (j == k) type_code = type_code + 3;
      if (type_code == 0){
        if ((i+j <= k) || (j+k <= i) || (i+k <= j))
  	  type_code = 4;
  	else
  	  type_code = 1;
      }
      else if (type_code > 3) type_code = 3;
      else if ((type_code == 1) && (i+j > k)) type_code = 2;
      else if ((type_code == 2) && (i+k > j)) type_code = 2;
      else if ((type_code == 3) && (j+k > i)) type_code = 2;
      else if (type_code > 10) type_code = -1;
      else type_code = 4;
    }
    return type_code;
  }

With this version of tritype, all tests will verify the assumed properties.
Note that with these `sc_assume` s, SeaCoral fail to cover some labels:

   [A]{Sc} Crash statistics: rte: none

This is because the first condition (`(i == 0) || (j == 0) || (k == 0)`) is
now unsatisfiable. In the current setting, each boolean expression is associated
to a specific label. The three labels  `i == 0`, `j == 0` and `k == 0` are now
unreachable, which can be proven by `cbmc` in assert mode:

   [A]{Sc} Uncoverable labels: {1, 3, 5, 35}
   [A]{Sc} Crash statistics: rte: none

Note that `sc_assume` can be used anywhere in the function.
Here is the exact semantic of
`reachability` with respect to `sc_assume`: a label `l` is reachable if and only if
there exist an input such that `l` is reached and all `sc_assume(p)` triggered during the
execution evaluate `p` as `true`.

NB: it is a bad practice to expect preconditions/invariants on values when performing
unit-testing. Still, in some cases, it is interesting to force some values. A test set
with null pointers leading to errors does not form the best coverage set. By assuming
pointers are not null, we can generate prettier test sets.

Fixtures
--------

Another way to control the input and the output of the tested function is through
the fixtures.
This feature allows to define, in a separate C file, two functions.
- An initialization function for constraining globals. They can be set up by assigning them using assumptions throught `sc_assume`, or directly by assigning them.
- An oracle function checking the tested function's result.

Fixtures can be used to check the proper behavior of the `tritype` function
with the structure set up as a global:

.. code-block:: c
  :caption: tritype-global.c

  struct triangle {
    int i;
    int j;
    int k;
  };

  struct triangle t;

  int tritype() {
    ...

The following file defines the initialization function `init` and the oracle function `oracle`.

.. code-block:: c
  :caption: fixtures-tritype.c

  #include<seacoral/annots.h>

  extern struct triangle t;
  enum state { EQUILATERAL, ISOSCELES };
  enum state kind;

  void init () {
    sc_assume(t.i > 0 && t.j > 0 && t.k > 0);
    sc_assume(kind == EQUILATERAL || kind == ISOSCELES);
    switch (kind) {
    case EQUILATERAL:
      sc_assume (t.i == t.j && t.j == t.k);
      break;
    case ISOSCELES:
      sc_assume(t.i == t.j || t.j == t.k || t.k == t.i);
      break;
    }
  }

  int oracle (int result) {
    switch (kind) {
    case EQUILATERAL:
      return (result == 3);
    case ISOSCELES:
      return (result == 2);
    }
    return 0;
  }

The initialization function checks that all lengths are positive, and assumes
two cases: the triangle can be equilateral, hence its sides have the same
length; or isosceles, and two of its sides have the same length.

The oracle checks that for equilateral triangle, the result will be 3, and that
for isosceles triangles, the result will be two. All the other cases are impossible.

Seacoral provides two modes for handling oracles. It can ignore oracle failures,
focusing on generating tests satisfying the oracle, or seek for oracle failures.
In our case, we are interested in the second case, with the option
`--seek-oracle-failures`.

   [A]{Sc} Uncoverable labels: {}
   [A]{Sc} Crash statistics: rte: none
   [A]{Sc} Oracle statistics: fails: 4 tests

Seacoral found 4 tests that made the oracle fail. These tests can be read in
`_sc/last/tests/fail/testsuite.c`.

- Test 1 `(kind = ISOSCELES, i = 16777216, j = 16777216, k = 50331648)` is not a real triangle, because `i + j < k`.
- Test 2 `(kind = ISOSCELES, i = 16777216, j = 16777216, k = 16777216)` is actually equilateral.
- Test 3 `(kind = ISOSCELES, i = 2130706432, j = 2130706432, k = 16777216)` is a real bug in the tritype function. The values of `i` and `j` provoke an integer overflow when calculating `i + j`.
- Test 4 `(kind = ISOSCELES, i = 16777216, j = 50331648, k = 16777216)` is equivalent to Test 1 switching `j` and `k`.

Execution modes
---------------

Seacoral has six different execution modes. Each mode can be run with `$ seacoral [MODE]`.

=========== ==========================================================================================
Mode
=========== ==========================================================================================
check       Check configuration and (optionally) perform initial project initialization
config      Managing configurations
doc         Dumps the seacoral configuration documentation
generate    Generate tests (default action)
initialize  Dump a configuration file with default options (alias for seacoral initialize) sub-command
replay      Replay the current test suite without starting any test generation tool
=========== ==========================================================================================

All these modes has a common set of options.

========================== ===================================================================================
Option                     Documentation
========================== ===================================================================================
-C, --config               Use the given configuration file
--clean-start              Remove the project with the same hash before starting its analysis (default: false)
--stats, --show-statistics Print statistics of the current run
--version                  Show version information.
========================== ===================================================================================

When run, seacoral will use the options defined in the `seacoral` configuration file specified
with the `-C` option.
More information on seacoral configuration in Section :ref:`configuration`.

Check
.....

This mode simply checks the :ref:`configuration` values from the given
configuration file and the command line arguments. If `--init` is used,
seacoral will also initialize the :ref:`project`'s workspace.
